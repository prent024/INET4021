# INET4021-lab1

### All files in cgi are with extension .cgi and written in python language
### Need to set the permission to 755 (Use chmod 755 * for every folder)
### Need to make sure that all files are executable on permission on server side
### For example, if you are using Apache server, then just set the root to 755 and align-root in order to set all permissions correctly. For this lab, need to manually set all files to 755.
